**KÒKTEL** is a **Full-Stack Website** fully designed and developed by me.
The data is provided by an external API, which is the CocktailDB API.
To develop the website, I used the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js).

Screenshots are attached to the root folder.

# Setup

If you'd like to use this app, follow these steps:

### Client Folder

1. Open terminal in VS Code
2. Type ` cd client`
3. Type `yarn install`
4. Type `yarn start` to get the client side running

### Server Folder

1. Open _another_ terminal in VS Code
2. Type `cd server`
3. Type `yarn install`
4. Type `yarn start` to get the server side running

<!-- ### Side Note

The _accounts_ (Signing in/up) and _favorites_ will not load, since I used MongoDB to provide this data.
In order to get these two to work, create a `.env` file in the `server` folder and connect your MongoDB to the app. -->
